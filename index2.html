                Puppies are our own stress relievers, they keep us accompanied in our times of
                loneliness. Pets also keep us fit and active, make great cuddle buddies and make 
                us less prone to allergies. All they bring to us we should be able to identify
                them. This webpage is built to identify your pet's breed off of photo recognition, 
                have fun with it!
